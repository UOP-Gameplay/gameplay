## Commit information

Changes need be made within their own branch, which can then be merged into main via a pull request. Aim to break changes up into seperate pull requests as this makes it easy to undo, modify, and visualise commit modifications. To avoid issues, ensure that commits do not include any conflicts. This can be done by refraining from modifying files such as levels or other binary files. If a pull request includes a change like this, make sure it is made obvious by including it within the message.
